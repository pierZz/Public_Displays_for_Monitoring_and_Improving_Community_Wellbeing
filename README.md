In order to make public displays more appreciated in their environment, previous research has proposed to open the displays to a wide range of sensors, applications, and user-contributed content. This project aims at the design and development of a public display app that utilizes a web camera situated on a public display for providing in-situ heart rate (HR) measurements. Users can simply launch the HR monitor app on a public display and get informed about their current HR levels. Optionally, users are able to share their HR levels within the community, which within a university setting may raise awareness about stress problems (e.g., during exam periods). 

This project needs a student with a strong development background in JavaScript, Java, and Python, and a willingness to learn about the public display API used on USI screens.
